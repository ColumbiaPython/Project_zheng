# scipy = scientific calculation
# numpy for data cleaning = matrix and array, more use for tensor
# pandas for data cleaning = large table, to import data, transfer from array to table, intertransfer with numpy
# sikt learn: lots of models, deep learning, 
# ML: want the model to learn from the past data and predict the future
# Train dataset (90%): for model to learn, test dataset (10%): to predict 
# seaborn: data visualization
