# Background: 
# Hurricane Florence brought heavy precipitation and flooding in North Carolina in September 2018. One of the big impacts is that the outbreak of “mosquito-pocalypse”, as coined by USA TODAY, dramatically increases the risk of the mosquitos-borne diseases. Dengue fever, which often causes serious bleeding and even death, is one of this type of diseases. In the past decade, it has been spreading rapidly in tropical climates where large amounts of mosquitos are breed, resulting in significant public health problems worldwide. Therefore, understanding the relationship between climate and the disease becomes necessary. More importantly, models that can accurately classify the disease outbreak cases or even predict the number of cases would help authorities in taking action to fight potential life-threatening pandemics.

# Purpose: 
# In this paper, firstly, I will do correlation tests to see how the different local climate variables are related to the weekly dengue fever cases in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Secondly, I will divide dengue weekly cases into 3 groups, based on the potential level for an outbreak to occur. Then I will run classification models to test and compare how well they classify these three groups of outbreak risk level. Thirdly, I will use regression models to examine how well they predict the number of weekly dengue cases and select the most effective method for use by the authorities. 

# Data: 
# The dataset contains 936 sampled weeks reporting weekly total number of dengue cases from 1999 to 2008 in San Juan, Puerto Rico with its corresponding weekly climate data. I found the dataset at Kaggle, a platform containing public datasets. However, the data originally comes from multiple sources: dengue surveillance data is provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides climate data. The covariates I will use for this paper mainly include about 18 climate attributes (such as precipitation, temperature, humidity, diurnal temperature range and vegetation) and one weekly dengue cases outcome variable. 

# Analysis Plan: 
# Part I Understand the relationship between dengue cases and climate variables: (1) Show descriptive statistics and histogram (2) Do the correlation tests among all variables and explain the result (3) Create data visualization for correlation
# Part II Use Classification Tree and Random Forest models to classify the three groups of dengue cases: (1) Explain why these two models are used (2) Divide the dataset into train set and test set (3) Use K-fold cross validation to gain the accuracy rate from both models (4) Interpret and compare the results from both models (5) Show visualization of the results
# Part III Use different regression models to predict the weekly dengue cases: (1) Use Best Subset Selection technique to select optimal numbers of variables for linear regression models (2) Use the optimal numbers of variables to predict weekly dengue cases by linear regression model (3) Run Lasso/Ridge regression model (4) Build Neural Network model (5) Evaluate and compare the accuracy of each model by MSE (6) Explanation of the results obtained by these models, their advantages and limitations
